## What is Web3
Web3 is an evolution of the internet that allows people to transact directly with each other:
- Users own their accounts, represented by their wallet.
- Transfers of value can occur directly between users.
- Tokens - representing currencies, digital art, event tickets, real estate, or whatever else - are fully under the custody of the user.
